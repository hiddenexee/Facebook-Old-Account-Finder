  <h1>ðŸ“˜ Facebook Old Account Finder</h1>

# Note:

This software has been prepared for educational purposes only.
It is a software open to development, do not expect support.

The software pulls emails from the x temp mail site and checks whether they have already registered with Facebook. If it finds a registered e-mail, it tries to set a new password by asking for the code.
<br><br>
I recommend you change the temp mail site here. (You can find more accounts by using more global sites)
<br><br>
I recommend using Residantel proxy (email sites can ban IP addresses with frequent requests).
<br><br>
You are free to develop the software, I take no responsibility.
<br><br>
You can star the project to support me. Thank you
